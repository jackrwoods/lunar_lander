# Terrain Generation Algorithm Pseudocode

Calculate a random size within a range. This determines the number of vectors.
In a loop, calculate 5 * size number of heights. Average these to find the heights of the final vectors.
Randomly choose between 3-5 pairs of vectors and replace them with PlatformVectors.
Point the last vector to the first vector in the LL.
