Gameplay:

  Player will start at the top of the screen "falling out of orbit." Below,
there will be terrain/obstacles to avoid as the player tries to land on a
platform. Platforms are determined by the line segment connecting two
PlatformVectors. If the player's ship is almost horizontal above a platform,
and they are falling at a speed less than -7 x, the ship will land and the
player will be rewarded the corresponding number of points for that platform.
Otherwise, the player's ship will crash.

  The ship will be controlled by W,A, & D where W engages thrust, A applies
rotation to the left, and D applies rotation to the right. Analog thrust
control will be implemented using the mouse scroll wheel.
