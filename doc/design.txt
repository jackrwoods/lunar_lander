render and update running at framerate
update runs on delta time, physics is at a set rate
physics should run lower than the framerate because generally the framerate will lag, and physics cannot lag (to account for little dips)

assume open space in update then render
physics calculates collisions and does that


1 Thread:
Update physics at a constant rate.
Physics pulls acceleration from player memory.
Physics is double-buffered.

1 Thread:
Get player input and update acceleration.
Render currently accessible physics buffer.
